# Python PWM Control Allwinner H3


This repository aims to add python control for the PWM functionality of the Allwinner H3 SoC. Specifically, the Orange Pi PC is used for testing. 

Searching for a similar solution, I could find none. This repository will extend the C implementation published by the user snowman on the [OrangePi forum](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepibbsen/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=1153). Details on the PWM usage and control are obtained from the H3 Datasheet.
